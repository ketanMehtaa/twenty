- **[Architecture Overview](/developers/frontend-development/architecture-overview)** - Comprehensive guide to the frontend architecture, technology stack, and core patterns
- **[Architecture Diagrams](/developers/frontend-development/architecture-diagrams)** - Visual representations of the architecture, data flows, and component relationships
- **[Folder Architecture](/developers/frontend-development/folder-architecture-front)** - Detailed explanation of the folder structure and organization

## Development Guidelines

Best practices and guidelines for writing quality code:

- **[Best Practices](/developers/frontend-development/best-practices-front)** - State management, re-renders, naming conventions, and more

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the development server
npx nx start twenty-front

# Run tests
npx nx test twenty-front

# Lint code
npx nx lint twenty-front

# Build for production
npx nx build twenty-front
```

## Key Concepts

### Modular Architecture
Twenty-front follows a feature-based modular architecture where each module represents a business feature with its own components, hooks, state, and GraphQL operations.

### State Management
The application uses Recoil for state management, providing atomic state updates and derived state through selectors. Apollo Client manages server data and caching.

### Type Safety
Comprehensive TypeScript coverage ensures type safety across the codebase. GraphQL types are automatically generated from the schema.

### Component System
UI components are organized in the `ui/` module and are completely independent of business logic, making them reusable and easy to test.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Vite** - Fast build tool with HMR
- **Recoil** - State management
- **Apollo Client** - GraphQL client
- **Emotion** - CSS-in-JS styling
- **Storybook** - Component development and documentation
